🧵 Process and Execution

    execve – Executes a program, replacing the current process image.

    fork – Creates a new process (a child) that is a copy of the current process.

    waitpid – Waits for a child process to change state (e.g., exit).

    kill – Sends a signal to a process (commonly used to terminate it).

    signal – Sets up a handler for specific signals (like SIGINT).

    strerror – Returns a human-readable string describing an errno value.

    errno – A global variable set by system calls when an error occurs.

🧠 Memory & Error Info

    gai_strerror – Returns a string describing a getaddrinfo error.

🛠️ File Descriptors

    dup, dup2 – Duplicate file descriptors; dup2 lets you specify the new FD.

    fcntl – Performs operations on file descriptors (e.g., non-blocking mode).

🧭 Networking (Sockets)

    socket – Creates a socket.

    bind – Binds a socket to an address and port.

    listen – Marks the socket as passive (ready to accept connections).

    accept – Accepts a new incoming connection on a listening socket.

    connect – Initiates a connection on a socket.

    send, recv – Sends or receives data over a socket.

    setsockopt – Sets options on sockets (e.g., reuse address).

    getsockname – Gets the address bound to a socket.

    getprotobyname – Gets protocol info by name (e.g., "tcp").

📡 Addressing & Name Resolution

    htons, htonl – Convert values from host to network byte order (short and long).

    ntohs, ntohl – Convert values from network to host byte order.

    getaddrinfo – Resolves hostnames and service names to address structures.

    freeaddrinfo – Frees memory allocated by getaddrinfo.

⏳ Multiplexing (I/O Waiting)

    select – Monitors multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible.

    poll – Similar to select but more scalable.

    epoll_create, epoll_ctl, epoll_wait – Linux-specific scalable I/O event notification system.

    kqueue, kevent – BSD/macOS equivalent of epoll for I/O event notification.

📁 Filesystem Operations

    access – Checks if the program can access a file (read/write/exec).

    stat – Retrieves information about a file (e.g., size, permissions).

    open, read, write, close – Basic file operations.

    opendir, readdir, closedir – Work with directories (open, read entries, close).

    chdir – Changes the current working directory.
